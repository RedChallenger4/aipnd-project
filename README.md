# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

## Setup

Get flower data:
```bash
mkdir -p data
cd data
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/flower_data.tar.gz
tar xzvf ./flower_data.tar.gz
```

You should now have **test**, **train** and **valid** directories containing classification directories and flower images under the **data** directory.

## Jupyter Notebook

To review the  `Image Classifier Project.ipynb` notebook, launch **Jupyter Notebook** from the project root:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
